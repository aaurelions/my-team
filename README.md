# Claude Agents: Your Autonomous AI Team

This repository is a blueprint for that reality. It's not about a single, monolithic AI, it's about creating a full roster of specialized AI agents that can work together to operate a project, a department, or even an entire business.

## What Are Agents?

In this context, an agent is a specialized AI persona with a dedicated system prompt and a defined set of responsibilities. By breaking down a large, complex task (like building a software product) into smaller, specialized roles, we can delegate work to different agents.

This approach helps to:

- **Improve Focus:** Each agent has a specific area of expertise, allowing it to provide more detailed and relevant output for its given task.
- **Manage Context:** Separating tasks into different agents prevents the context window from becoming cluttered with irrelevant information, leading to more coherent and accurate results.
- **Simulate a Team:** It allows a single user to simulate a multi-disciplinary team, leveraging specialized "experts" for different parts of a project.

## Directory Structure

The agents are organized into directories based on the core functions of a typical product development team. Each `.md` file contains a description and the primary responsibilities for that agent's role.

### `/engineering`

Contains agents responsible for the technical creation and maintenance of the product.

- **`ai-engineer.md`**: Designs and implements machine learning models.
- **`backend-architect.md`**: Manages server-side logic, databases, and APIs.
- **`devops-automator.md`**: Automates and streamlines the development and deployment pipeline.
- **`frontend-developer.md`**: Builds the user-facing interface and experience.
- **`mobile-app-builder.md`**: Develops applications for mobile devices.
- **`rapid-prototyper.md`**: Quickly builds functional mockups and prototypes.

### `/product`

Contains agents focused on the strategy, direction, and definition of the product.

- **`feedback-synthesizer.md`**: Collects and analyzes user feedback to identify key insights.
- **`sprint-prioritizer.md`**: Manages the product backlog and prioritizes tasks for development sprints.
- **`trend-researcher.md`**: Identifies and analyzes market trends to inform product strategy.

### `/marketing`

Contains agents responsible for promoting the product and engaging with the community.

- **`app-store-optimizer.md`**: Improves app visibility and downloads in app stores.
- **`content-creator.md`**: Produces marketing content like blog posts, videos, and graphics.
- **`growth-hacker.md`**: Executes creative, data-driven experiments to grow the user base.

- **`reddit-community-builder.md`**: Engages with relevant communities on Reddit.
- **`tiktok-strategist.md`**: Develops and executes the brand's TikTok strategy.
- **`twitter-engager.md`**: Manages real-time conversations and engagement on Twitter.

### `/design`

Contains agents focused on the user experience and visual identity of the product.

- **`brand-guardian.md`**: Ensures brand consistency across all materials.
- **`ui-designer.md`**: Creates the visual look and feel of the user interface.
- **`ux-researcher.md`**: Conducts research to understand user needs and behaviors.

### `/project-management`

Contains agents responsible for organizing, planning, and executing projects.

- **`experiment-tracker.md`**: Documents and tracks all experiments and their outcomes.
- **`project-shipper.md`**: Coordinates the final stages of a project to ensure a smooth launch.
- **`studio-producer.md`**: Manages creative projects from briefing to final delivery.

### `/studio-operations`

Contains agents that handle the day-to-day operational needs of the team.

- **`analytics-reporter.md`**: Tracks and reports on key performance metrics.

- **`infrastructure-maintainer.md`**: Ensures the stability and performance of technical infrastructure.
- **`legal-compliance-checker.md`**: Ensures the company adheres to relevant laws and regulations.
- **`support-responder.md`**: Provides assistance and resolves issues for users.

### `/testing`

Contains agents dedicated to ensuring the quality and reliability of the product.

- **`api-tester.md`**: Tests APIs for functionality, performance, and security.
- **`performance-benchmarker.md`**: Measures and analyzes application performance under load.
- **`test-results-analyzer.md`**: Interprets test data to provide insights on product quality.
