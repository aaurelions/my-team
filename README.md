# Claude Agents: Your Autonomous AI Team

This repository is a blueprint for that reality. It's not about a single, monolithic AI, it's about creating a full roster of specialized AI agents that can work together to operate a project, a department, or even an entire business.

## What Are Agents?

In this context, an agent is a specialized AI persona with a dedicated system prompt and a defined set of responsibilities. By breaking down a large, complex task (like building a software product) into smaller, specialized roles, we can delegate work to different agents.

This approach helps to:

- **Improve Focus:** Each agent has a specific area of expertise, allowing it to provide more detailed and relevant output for its given task.
- **Manage Context:** Separating tasks into different agents prevents the context window from becoming cluttered with irrelevant information, leading to more coherent and accurate results.
- **Simulate a Team:** It allows a single user to simulate a multi-disciplinary team, leveraging specialized "experts" for different parts of a project.

## Directory Structure

The agents are organized into directories based on the core functions of a typical product development team. Each `.md` file contains a description and the primary responsibilities for that agent's role.
