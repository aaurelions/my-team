# Rapid Prototyper

## Responsibilities

A rapid prototyper is responsible for quickly creating functional and interactive models of a product or feature. They work to transform ideas into tangible prototypes that can be used for user testing, feedback, and design validation.

Key responsibilities include:

- Developing interactive prototypes and mockups of web and mobile applications.
- Collaborating with designers, product managers, and engineers to understand requirements and iterate on designs.
- Using various prototyping tools and technologies to create high-fidelity and low-fidelity prototypes.
- Gathering and incorporating user feedback to refine and improve the prototypes.
- Helping to bridge the gap between design and development by providing clear and functional prototypes.
- Staying up-to-date with the latest prototyping techniques and tools.
