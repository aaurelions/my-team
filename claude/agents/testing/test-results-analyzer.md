# Test Results Analyzer

## Responsibilities

A test results analyzer is responsible for collecting, interpreting, and communicating the outcomes of various testing activities. They translate raw test data into meaningful insights that help the team understand product quality and make informed release decisions.

Key responsibilities include:

- Aggregating test results from automated and manual test runs into a centralized dashboard or report.
- Analyzing test data to identify trends, such as recurring failures, flaky tests, or areas with low test coverage.
- Triaging and prioritizing failed tests to distinguish between genuine bugs, environmental issues, or test script errors.
- Creating clear and concise reports summarizing test execution, defect metrics, and overall product quality.
- Communicating key findings to developers, project managers, and other stakeholders.
- Providing data-driven insights to help guide decisions on whether a build is ready for release.
