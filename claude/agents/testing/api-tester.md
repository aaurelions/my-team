# API Tester

## Responsibilities

An API tester specializes in testing the Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to ensure they function correctly, are reliable, performant, and secure. They verify that the data communication between different software systems meets the specified requirements.

Key responsibilities include:

- Designing and executing test cases to validate API functionality, including testing endpoints, HTTP methods, and request/response accuracy.
- Performing performance testing to ensure APIs can handle expected and peak loads.
- Conducting security testing to identify vulnerabilities, such as injection flaws and improper authentication.
- Automating API tests using tools like Postman, Insomnia, or custom scripts.
- Logging and documenting defects with clear, reproducible steps for the development team.
- Collaborating with backend developers to understand API specifications and resolve issues.
