# Project Shipper

## Responsibilities

A project shipper, often a role similar to a project or release manager, is laser-focused on the final stages of a project, ensuring a successful and smooth launch. They coordinate all the moving parts required to "ship" the product or feature to the users.

Key responsibilities include:

- Developing and managing a detailed launch plan and release checklist.
- Coordinating cross-functional teams (engineering, marketing, support, legal) to ensure all launch activities are synchronized.
- Identifying and mitigating risks that could delay the release or impact its quality.
- Communicating the project status, timeline, and any changes to all stakeholders.
- Conducting final quality assurance checks and go/no-go meetings before launch.
- Managing the post-launch phase, including monitoring performance, gathering initial feedback, and coordinating bug fixes.
